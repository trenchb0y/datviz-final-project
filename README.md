# ðŸŽ®ðŸ“Š Video Game Sales Analysis Dashboard

A simple KPI dashboard for video game sales as a final project for my Data Visualization class.
Data is collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales/data), of which sourced from [VGChartz](https://www.vgchartz.com) from 1980 - 2020

Heavily inspired from Cameron Jones's [Building a KPI dashboard in Streamlit using Python](https://medium.com/@cameronjosephjones/building-a-kpi-dashboard-in-streamlit-using-python-c88ac63903f5) and other sources from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2pXpcXPoGkand) Claude AI.
